MultiDesk (F)requently (A)sked (Q)uestions:
===========================================

Q: My applications frequently crash in PMMERGE.DLL on secondary desktops.

A: This may be a problem with font paths. If you have moved your fonts,
   chances are that the newly created INI files will contain bad paths,
   pointing to non-existent places. Also, if the paths don't have a drive
   letter, OS/2 looks in the boot drive as default. Make the necessary
   corrections (you can use regedit2.exe) and the crashes are gone.

Q: Upon starting Multidesk Administrator I have the following error:
   << Routine not found in CT_NewLine = CT_NewLine||AFGetBootDrive()||':' >>

A: This error has been reported by a few users during testing. The solution
   is to switch from Object Rexx to Classic Rexx, or the other way around. 
   Some users never have problems, others have problems with one of the two
   language parsers. I still have not clearly undertstood what's going on, 
   but the switch seems to cure all problems. You can find a script on
   hobbes.nmsu.edu that switches rexx interpreters on the fly.
   Look for swrexx.zip using Hobbes' search engine.

Q: How can I change the default password given by Multidesk Administrator to
   new users? Do I need to use a text editor?
   
A: No, you don't need it. Multidesk Administrator main window simply is a
   standard container view, so you can use in-place editing to change what you
   want. You can change the password, the various paths, etc.. BE CAREFUL
   though, if you change the user's name you'll screw you user <-> desktop
   association. User renaming will be part of the upcoming functionality to
   be included in the "Manage Users Desktops" option.

Q: May I use drag and drop to copy things from the active desktop to another
   user's desktop?
   
A: Using (or even opening) other users' desktops while they're not active is
   definitely not a good idea. If you drop a file on another user's desktop
   he will see it on his desktop when he will log in, but this works only with
   physical (i.e. file system) entities. You can't do this with abstract
   objects (i.e. program objects and the like). Abstract objects are
   represented by structures in your INI files, so they're totally useless when
   used on another desktop (which has another set of INI files).
   Also, even if you open another desktop just to look at it, there is a chance
   that OS/2 will try to interpret the objects that are found there, and will
   start updating your INI files with plenty of garbage handles. The most
   common problem is that you get multiple startup folders registered in your
   INI files. Even if your desktop won't be able to start objects in other
   desktop's startup folders, this often leads to malfunctions.

Q: The installer from Netscape (Java, etc) fails with an unknown error.
Q: The installation of Netscape (Java, etc) seems to work, but the program
   isn't working correctly.
   
A: The problem isn't with the programs, but with the installer itself.
   Unfortunately, the IBM installer (feature installer) always assumes that
   the user and system INI files are located in the \OS2 directory of the boot
   drive. This is obviously a perfect example of bad programming...
   What this means is that if you don't have OS2.INI and/or OS2SYS.INI in the
   \OS2 directory, the installer will most probably crash.
   Even if you have OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI in the \OS2 directory, you may end
   up with a corrupted installation, if you're installing from another desktop
   (that is, a desktop that uses INIs from another location).
   The work-around is to always have a set of INIs in \OS2. After the
   installation, look in these INIs to see if the installer has written
   something there, and copy those values to your true INIs.

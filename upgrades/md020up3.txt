MultiDesk 0.2.0 upgrade 3
=========================

This is the third upgrade to the MultiDesk 0.2.0 distribution. This upgrades
a lot of components, so I think a new distribution is approaching (as soon
as I find time to fix a couple things and assemble it).

As always, the archive is "incremental", that is: it includes the newly 
updated files AND all the updated files from upgrade 1 and 2.

Installation:

 Simply copy all the updated files over the old ones, and add the new ones.
 
 Before rebooting, add an \MMOS2 subdirectory the every user directory,
 then copy there your MMPM.INI file (if you want to have the same sound
 settings for all users), or build a new MMPM.INI file from the template
 (MAKEINI MMPM.INI mmit.rc) and put it there.


Changes:
	
    - Incorporated the changes from Pete Brown regarding Sound Schemes
      switching among users (modified to verify MMPM installation).

    - Changes in all other modules (MuAdmin, Installation, scripts, etc.)
      to behave correctly with the new MMOS2 directory in the user tree.

    - Changes to MuAdmin to use the MMBASE environment variable, instead
      of the hard-coded x:\MMOS2 path (this was a long overdue fix, that
      I always postponed due to my laziness ;^))
      
    - Created a new template for MMPM.INI: now every new user gets a
      standard MMPM.INI file, with and empty sound scheme and system
      sounds disabled.
      
    - Fixed a bug where the user tree path could not be determined
      by the pre-login script (unless it was the standard x:\Users).
      
    - Added a \Docs\contrib subdirectry to hold user-contributed scripts
      (for now it only contains scripts by Pete Brown).
      
    - User environment files can now contain blank lines, and can contain
      comments (lines beginning with '#'). Mudesk now does a (little) bit
      of checking over the lines to see if they are suitable for the
      environment. If you type "rem goofy=minnie" MuDesk will ignore it,
      NOT because of the "rem", but because of the wrong format (a space
      before the "=").


Enjoy! :-)

MultiDesk 0.2.0 upgrade 2
=========================

This is the second upgrade to the MultiDesk 0.2.0 distribution. It includes
the new MultiDesk Administrator, that supports and generates encrypted
passwords.

It is a drop-in replacement of MuAdmin.exe and AuxFuncs.dll.

Note that the archive is "incremental", that is: it includes the newly 
updated files AND all the updated files from upgrade 1.

Enjoy! :-)

MultiDesk 0.2.0 upgrade 1
=========================

This is the first upgrade to the MultiDesk 0.2.0 distribution. It supports
standard crypt()-encoded passwords in the mudesk.dat file.

It is a drop-in replacement of MuDesk.exe and FAQ.txt. 

Since the new MuDesk Administrator, which supports encoding of passwords, 
still is not ready, I'm providing a command line tool (crypt.exe) which 
encrypts a password. You can then edit the mudesk.dat file replacing the
clear-text password with the encrypted one, or you can use the MultiDesk
Adminitrator, and cut and paste the resulting encoded password in the
password field.

The new MultiDesk Administrator will be available shortly.

BE CAREFUL: don't reboot your box with the new mudesk.exe if you haven't
changed the mudesk.dat file: MuDesk would try to interpret the unencrypted
password as an encrypted one, and you wouldn't be able to login anymore.

ONE LAST NOTE: the standard crypt() algorithm only supports password lengths
up to eight characters. If you use a longer password, any password beginning
with the same eight characters would match.

Enjoy! :-)

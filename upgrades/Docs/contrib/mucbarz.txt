   I guess I could follow the Linux/Unix community and call this
   How To: Multi User CandyBarZ

   Or,  "To each User a CandybarZ?"

   PLEASE: Read this through carefully BEFORE following the instructions.

   CandyBarZ is, I find, an almost indispensible "WPS beautifier". The
   trouble is so do several other people using this PC and they insist on
   having access to it. I would not mind if every User had their "own"
   CandyBarZ scheme - I do object to having to reset my scheme when another
   User changes their scheme though.

   The problem is the CandyBar.INI file. In the Documentation for CandyBarZ
   there is talk of being able to select the location for the CandyBar.INI
   file. Something I have never seen on the Setup screen for CandyBarZ V1.40.

   Using INIEditor V1.10 (from [1]http://Goran_Ivankovic.tripod.com/  look
   for INITOOL110.ZIP) I inspected the OS2.INI file and found 2 Keys for
   Application CandyBarz. The Key called Profile stores the location of the
   candybar.ini file.

   Yes I tried to set this up the easy way but it does not work. CandyBarZ
   seems to check it's INI file location once only and possibly save that
   location within the program. I installed CandyBarZ for 4 Users in total
   (one at a time) and edited each Users OS2.INI file to change the CandyBarZ
   Profile to the Users home directories (\Users\matty\ , \Users\nicki\ 
   etc..) before rebooting.

   The only candybar.ini file recognised was the first one used!

   Well, as that don't work we can always do some "INI file swapping".
   However we cannot do this in an OS/2 CommandFile after the system has
   loaded. CandyBarZ needs to be able to access it's INI file at startup -
   otherwise your beautiful desktop fails to load and you end up with that
   slightly-old-clunky OS/2 look.

   This has a lot  of similarity to the Sound Scheme problem. To solve that I
   had to modify the Pre and Post Login scripts; which is what I have done
   here. Please feel free to use these modifications in your own system if
   you wish.

   Please make sure that you follow these instructions carefully to get
   "Multi User CandyBarZ" working correctly - I am not offering guarantees,
   but get one little thing wrong and it definitely will not work.

   Setup Steps

   To avoid problems it is best to Uninstall CandyBarZ from all Users
   Desktops where it is currently Installed. You can use the CandyBarZ Setup
   Uninstall and follow it with an Install to minimize reboots if you have
   several Users - there are 4 on this PC. Do not delete the CandyBarZ files
   or directory. You should, after a bout of reboots, have UNinstalled and
   then re-INstalled CandyBarZ on all Users Desktops.

   It is best to Install CandyBarZ for every User. If a User does not want
   these enhancements it is easy enough to set CandyBarZ to the Empty theme,
   which is a standard Warp 4 theme.

   Having performed all of the installations it is now necessary to reboot to
   start CandyBarZ for the first time and create the default CandyBar.ini
   file. NOTE that so far all we have done is Install CandyBarZ and reboot to
   Login as the next User to perform the CandyBarZ Install for that User
   until all Users have CandyBarZ installed.

   Reboot and Login as the Administrator and you should be rewarded by the
   Default CandyBarZ Theme making your Desktop more interesting. DO NOT
   change any settings at this time.

   Instead, copy the CandyBar.ini file from the CandyBarZ Directory to the
   Home Directory of every User - thats right give everyone a copy of this
   INI file. Just to jog your memory - I discovered that CandyBarZ
   "recognises" the correct INI file, the one it knows that it created,
   somehow. So every User MUST have a copy of this file to start with. You
   will also need to keep a copy safe somewhere on your system in case you
   ever add a New User, in which case you will need to give the New User a
   copy of this file.

   OK every User has CandyBarZ installed and a copy of the INI file. Time to
   update the Pre and Post Login scripts.

   The Script Modifications

   STEP 1

   This is the section to add to the Pre-Login script, "mdstart.cmd", which
   should be located in your MultiDesk Directory, "\apps\mudesk" or
   "\mudesk", wherever that may be. This bit of script will copy the
   candybar.ini file from the \CandyBarZ directory to the Directory of the
   User named in the file Last - who should be the last User so it should be
   their copy of candybar.ini with their scheme.

   Open the file \mudesk\mdstart.cmd with the System Editor

   Select the following block of text in green and copy it (ALT+E, C)

   /* Save previous User CandyBarZ.INI file to previous User directory */
   /* Modified 09/08/2001 by Pete Brown */
   /* NOTE: The statement "DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'" below MUST be changed
   to */
   /* the correct Drive:\Path location of CandyBarZ for other systems that
   this script is used on */
   CBarZINIPath = UTreePath || LastUser
   DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'
   '@copy ' || DrivePath || '\CandyBar.ini ' || CBarZINIPath || ' 1> nul 2>
   nul'
   /* End Pete Brown modification */

   Then, in the System Editor,  Paste (ALT+P) the selected text above the
   line
          DestPath = UTreePath || LastUser || '\WC'

   Handy that the System Editor does not recognise green unless set to
   display in that colour - the text pasted should now be the same colour as
   the existing text :-)

   Before Saving this modified file it is necessary to change the statement
   "DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'". You will need to change this to the
   Drive:\Location of CandyBarZ on your system eg:-
      DrivePath = 'e:\toys\CandyBarZ'
   or
      DrivePath = 'C:\CandyBarZ'

   Then Save the file, selecting to overwrite the existing file
   (mdstart.cmd). Do not close the System Editor.

   NOTE: If you have used the modified Pre and Post Login scripts to enable
   Users to have different Sound Schemes make sure that the "mdstart.cmd"
   file that you modify is the version that includes the Sound modifications.
   Your original script - without the Sound section - should be called
   "mdstart.cmd.ORG" but do double-check.

   STEP 2

   This is the section to add to the Post-Login script, "mdstart.usr", which
   should be located in your MultiDesk Directory, "\apps\mudesk" or
   "\mudesk", wherever that may be. This bit of script will copy the
   candybar.ini file from the Users Home Directory to the CandyBarZ Directory
   after the User has successfully Logged On.

   Still in the System Editor click File, Open and select the mudesk.usr file
   - the template for the Post Login script.

   Select the following block of text in green and copy it (ALT+E, C)

   /* Save previous User CandyBarZ.INI file to previous User directory */
   /* Modified 09/08/2001 by Pete Brown */
   /* NOTE: The statement "DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'" below MUST be changed
   to */
   /* the correct Drive:\Path location of CandyBarZ for other systems that
   this script is used on */
   CBarZINIPath = UTreePath || User
   DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'
   '@del ' || DrivePath || '\CandyBar.ini 1> nul 2> nul'
   '@copy ' || CBarZINIPath || '\CandyBar.ini ' || DrivePath || ' 1> nul 2>
   nul'
   /* End Pete Brown modification */

   Then, in the System Editor,  Paste (ALT+P) the selected text above the
   line
          OrgPath = UTreePath || User || '\WC'

   Again, before Saving this modified file it is necessary to change the
   statement "DrivePath = 'J:\CandyBarZ'". You will need to change this to
   the Drive:\Location of CandyBarZ on your system eg:-
      DrivePath = 'e:\toys\CandyBarZ'
   or
      DrivePath = 'C:\CandyBarZ'

   Then Save the file, selecting to overwrite the existing file
   (mdstart.usr).

   Close the System Editor and open the Properties notebook for the
   mdstar.usr file. Make sure that the Type property is "OS/2 Command File".

   Now copy this file "mdstart.usr", renaming it as part of the copy process
   to  "mdstart.cmd", to each Users Directory and selecting to overwrite the
   existing file.

   NOTE: If you have used the modified Pre and Post Login scripts to enable
   Users to have different Sound Schemes make sure that the "mdstart.usr"
   file that you modify is the template that includes the Sound
   modifications. Your original template - without the Sound section - should
   be called "mdstart.usr.ORG" but do double-check.

   That's It

   You should now have CandyBarZ installed for every User, complete with
   their own copy of CandyBar.ini and both Pre and Post Login scripts
   modified to shuffle these INI files around.

   Just to prove the point you should now change the current (should be
   Administrator) Users CandyBarZ scheme from the Default.
   Having selected a scheme, applied and saved  it Open the CandyBarZ
   directory in Details View and check the size of the CandyBar.ini file. It
   should be a different size from the copies made and saved to other Users
   Directories before you changed the scheme.

   Now it's time to reboot and Login as a different User. You should get the
   Default scheme, not the scheme that you just applied to the Administrators
   Desktop.

   If you do get stuck somehow please email me with full details of what went
   wrong, how many User Desktops and Drive:\Directory locations for
   CandyBarZ, OS2 Boot Drive, MultiDesk Directory - in fact, anything that
   you think could be relevant.

   At this point in time I can only state that the above description of "How
   To: Multi User CandyBarZ" has worked on the only 2 PCs running OS/2 that I
   have access to.

   For reference both PCs are running:-
     * Warp 4 Fixpack 15 + Kernel 14.072a_W4, DDPak 2, IBMs' SDD 704,
       MultiDesk V0.2.0, CandyBarZ V1.40
   Happy Individual Visual Desktops :-)

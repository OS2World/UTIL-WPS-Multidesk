(v1.02) HyperText/2 - FREEWARE
This package allows you to easily create
powerful OS/2 INF files with only a handfull
of commands instead of the complex set of IPF
commands. Unlike other packages, HyperText/2
cannot produce Win help files or HTML files,
but it is freeware (also unlike other tools)
:-)

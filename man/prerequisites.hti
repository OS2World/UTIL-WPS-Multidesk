You should be able to use [=TITLE] under OS/2 release 4 (Warp) and up.
I've been using it on OS/2 Warp 4 (with all recent fixpacks and kernels),
and on WSeB up to fixpack 2 (with various kernels).

[=TITLE] requires the following:
.ul
- *REXX* installed
- a boot partition which supports long file names (HPFS, JFS, etc).

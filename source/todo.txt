BUGS/PROBLEMS?:

   Case sensitiveness of names and passwords. (verify)
   Differences in this respect between MuDesk and MuAdmin. (verify)
   The desktop archiving feature of OS/2 does not cope with multiple desktops.
   (--> every time you create a desktop, you'll be overwriting the archive
        number 0 - I may stop this by removing arcinst.exe from the INI
        template. But this is not a real solution.) >REMOVED_ARCINST.EXE<

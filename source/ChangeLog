	* ADMIN2.RES, mudesk.c, mudesk.cfg, mudesk.h:
	ADMIN2.RES: Some small corrections related to the new name (but the real
                    working version is at home, and needs to be integrated).
	mudesk.* - Added two new CFG options: root_user and relaxed_security.
		   Now it is possible to configure root's name (root_user).
		   Now it is possible to bypass password asking, but for the
                   root user (relaxed_security).
		   Now it is possible to log in with default user simply by
                   pressing enter (relaxed_security).
		   For security reasons, MuDesk now looks for the DAT file in
                   his own directory (removed the command line parameter).

2000-12-22  Cristiano Guadagnino  <guadagnino.cristiano@creval.it>

	* mudesk.h: Forgot to add mudesk.h :-)

	* mudesk.c, mudesk.cfg, mudesk.dat, MuDesk.prj, admin.DLG, admin.H,
	* admin.RES, login.bnr, login.c, login.c.branch, login.cfg, login.dat,
	* mudesk.bnr, Login.prj:

	* ADMIN2.H, ADMIN2.DLG: Reworked action buttons.
	Now the controls resize dinamically with the dialog. I had to code
	this explicitely, because bitmap-buttons would otherwise scale,
	resulting in an ugly looking window.

	* mdicons.dll, ADMIN2.RES: Mods for CVS binary handling.

2000-12-15  Cristiano Guadagnino  <guadagnino.cristiano@creval.it>

	* mdicons.dll, ADMIN2.DLG, ADMIN2.H, ADMIN2.RES:
	mdicons.dll: Reworked bitmap background, for a better integration with the
                 dialog window background.
	admin2.*: New release of the users' administration application.
              Realized with a container control.

2000-12-11  Cristiano Guadagnino  <guadagnino.cristiano@creval.it>

	* admin.DLG, admin.H, admin.RES, mdicons.dll:
	Updated code to check for existence of login.dat in current dir, and output a warning
	accordingly. Changed message for the non-authorized users (non-root).
	Implemented reading of DAT file.
	Partially implemented the filling of dialog fields with DAT file data, and
	enabling/disabling buttons accordingly.

	New idea: created a new form with a container control to display all users
	at once (uses mdicons.dll)
	Added mdicons.dll: Icon resources for the container view.

	TODO: change the "name" combobox back to a normal entryfield.. user choice
	will be done at the container level. => I can reenable the CANVAS background
	control (eyecandy).

2000-12-06  Cristiano Guadagnino  <guadagnino.cristiano@creval.it>

	* admin.H 1.2, admin.RES 1.3:
	Implemented control for authorization, in Administator applet.

	* login.c 1.2, admin.DLG 1.1, admin.H 1.1, admin.RES 1.2:
	Prototype implementation of the MultiDesk (ÊDesk) Administration Tool.
	Still it is a GUI-only implementation.. all procedures are stubs.

	* Login.prj 1.1.1.1, admin.RES 1.1.1.1, login.bnr 1.1.1.1, 
	* login.c 1.1.1.1, login.c.branch 1.1.1.1, login.cfg 1.1.1.1,
	* login.dat 1.1.1.1:
	Initial import of LoginTool sources.

	The following enhancements are made over the previous (non-CVS)
	sources:
		- Added config-file parsing. Config file is named login.cfg.
		- Added possibility to set screen-saver timeout.
		- Added default-user, with automatic login after a (settable)
			timeout.
		- Added logging. Both successful and unsuccsessful logins are
			logged. Log file name and path is configurable. Root
			can choose to enable/disable logging.
		- Added "root" user. It is the only user that can edit the
			config file and the passwords file. Also it is the
			only user that can see the log.

	* Login.prj 1.1, admin.RES 1.1, login.bnr 1.1, login.c 1.1, 
	* login.c.branch 1.1, login.cfg 1.1, login.dat 1.1:

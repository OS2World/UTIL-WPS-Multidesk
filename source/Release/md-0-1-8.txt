       Short Description: Multi users/desktops for OS/2
        Long Description: MultiDesk will let you have multiple desktops and users under OS/2.
                          While it is still in early beta stages, it already lets you create,
                          delete and manage desktops; define users; customize environment,
                          video resolution, etc for each user; lock some files from other
                          users' eyes; etc.. Desktops and users are created with an easy to
                          use management tool.

                          (e.g. if your boot drive is e:, change "?:\" to "e:\").

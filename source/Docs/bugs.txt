Known problems and limitations:

   . Case sensitiveness of names and passwords. (Is it desireable?)
   
   . Differences in this respect between MuDesk and MuAdmin. (verify)
   
   . The desktop archiving feature of OS/2 does not cope with multiple desktops.
     Users should use another archiving product.
   
   . Keep users' directory name as short as possible. User names, also.
     (This is an OS/2 problem with length of pathnames)
   
   . Users should check the Groups.csv file, to see if it matches their
     INI files: Application and Key names may vary with nationalized
     OS/2 versions.

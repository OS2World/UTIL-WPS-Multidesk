Hi! My name is Cristiano Guadagnino, and I'm a TeamOS/2 Italy member.
<p>I have a home page at <a href="http://guadagnino.tripod.com">http://guadagnino.tripod.com</a>
but it's very outdated. It contains some pieces of my free software (mostly
outdated also), but I have a bunch of little tools and bigger projects
that aren't presented there.
<p>I hope I'll be able to update the pages shortly, but I'm very short
on spare time, and prefer to code rather than update those.
<p>If you want to contact me, my addresses are:
<blockquote><a href="mailto:criguada@libero.it">criguada@libero.it</a>
<br><a href="mailto:criguada@tin.it">criguada@tin.it</a></blockquote>
<br>
<br>At least one of these should always be working.

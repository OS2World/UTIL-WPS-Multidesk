<h2>
Welcome to MultiDesk v0.2.0!</h2>
<img SRC="warning.png" ALT="Warning!" NOSAVE height=41 width=136>
<p>This is a beta release, so the usual <a href="disclaim.html">disclaimers</a>
apply. Also please note that this program messes with your desktop and
INI files, so <b>PLEASE</b> make a backup before installing/using it. Even
if I tested thoroughly the program and found no dangerous situations, it's
always better to be safe than sorry.

<i>&micro;Desk</i> (stands for <b>MultiDesk</b>) is a program that will
let you have multiple desktops on OS/2.
<p>Actually, it does something more: it presents you with a login screen
at boot time, and when a user is recognized it can:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
setup environment variables (e.g. HOME, USER, etc)</li>

<li>
lock some files so that users won't touch them</li>

<li>
run a customizable rexx script before and after login</li>

<li>
start a customized desktop</li>

<li>
keep track of logins (user name, time, failed logins..)</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>NOTE</b>: MultiDesk offers some mild security features. While
this features will probably improve in the future, don't expect too much
from this: every user with enoguh skills and knowledge of OS/2 can bypass
it. I'm not going to use SES (at least for now) because it is too buggy
at this stage.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The &micro;Desk package includes two programs: <b>&micro;Desk</b> itself,
which manage logins,
<br>and <b>&micro;Admin</b>, which manage user/desktop pairs.
<p>&micro;Desk is very easily configured through a simple text file, with
few options.
<br>A <a href="sampcfg.html">sample configuration file</a> is included,
with tons of comments.
<p><a href="muadmin.html">&micro;Admin</a> don't need any configuration,
and will instead help you (the
<br>administrator) to create/manage the users and their desktops.
<p>Here are the contents of the folder as created by the installation package:

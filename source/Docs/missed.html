<blockquote>The <b><i>mudesk.bnr&nbsp; </i></b>file is a banner that you
can customize. It is displayed just before the login request upon boot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <b><i>&lt;user>.env</i></b>&nbsp; file contains entries
that are added to the main environment. You can use <i>variable substitution</i>&nbsp;
here. For example, if you want to add the e:\apps\dummy directory to the
path, you can add a line resembling the following:
<p>PATH=%PATH%;e:\apps\dummy;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <b><i>mudesk.lck</i></b>&nbsp; file is initially a 0-byte
file. But if you enter one (or more) fully-qualified pathname(s) here,
they'll be locked on next reboot. You can enter as many lines as you want,
one pathname for each line. Remember that those locked files are always
accessible to the <i>root</i>&nbsp; user.
<p>The <b><i>mdstart.cmd</i></b>&nbsp; file in MultiDesk's directory is
the pre-login rexx script. It is customizable by the administrator. Look
in the source to see which parameters are passed by the login program.
<p>The <b><i>mdstart.cmd</i></b>&nbsp; file in each user directory is the
post-login rexx script. It is executed when the user is recognized after
login, and is customizable by every user. Look in the source to see which
parameters are passed by the login program.
<p>The <b><i>mdstart.usr</i></b> file in MultiDesk's directory is the <b>template</b>
used to create the post-login rexx script for each user. The administrator
may adapt it, to make common changes that he wants for every new user created.

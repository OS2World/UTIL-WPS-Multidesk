MultiDesk (F)requently (A)sked (Q)uestions:
===========================================

Q: My applications frequently crash in PMMERGE.DLL on secondary desktops.

A: This may be a problem with font paths. If you have moved your fonts,
   chances are that the newly created INI files will contain bad paths,
   pointing to non-existent places. Also, if the paths don't have a drive
   letter, OS/2 looks in the boot drive as default. Make the necessary
   corrections (you can use regedit2.exe) and the crashes are gone.

Q: Upon starting Multidesk Administrator I have the following error:
   << Routine not found in CT_NewLine = CT_NewLine||AFGetBootDrive()||':' >>

A: This error has been reported by a few users during testing. The solution
   is to switch from Object Rexx to Classic Rexx, or the other way around. 
   Some users never have problems, others have problems with one of the two
   language parsers. I still have not clearly undertstood what's going on, 
   but the switch seems to cure all problems. You can find a script on
   hobbes.nmsu.edu that switches rexx interpreters on the fly.
   Look for swrexx.zip using Hobbes' search engine.

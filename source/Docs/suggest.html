<img SRC="whoneed.png" ALT="Who needs it?" NOSAVE height=35 width=193></h2>

<ul>
<li>
Developers who want a <b><i>fast</i></b>, light desktop, with only the
tools needed to</li>

<br>develop their applications and no fancy (and crashy) things. Also they
can
<br>experiment with WPS programming without touching their 'real' desktop.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Home users who want to share their PC with their wife/husband/son(s).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Users who like to fiddle with their WPS, or like to experiment new (and
risky)</li>

<br>software.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Users who have an instable desktop: they can crate a new, fresh one, use
a</li>

<br>product to do a 'portable' backup of their old desktop (e.g. with Object
<br>Desktop, WPTools, UniMaint), and then restore it on the newly created
desktop.
<br>They will have a copy of the desktop without all the instabilities
due to
<br>installing/removing/reinstalling of objects/classes. And they can test
it to
<br>see if it fits their needs before removing the old one!!</ul>

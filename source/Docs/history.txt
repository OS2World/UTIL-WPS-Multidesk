   History:
   ========
   
   v0.2.0
   ======
   
   . MuAdmin: Creation of multimedia folder, and the "multimedia setup"
     object, in new desktops.
     
   . MuAdmin: Added a group to copy XWorkplace Settings while customizing
     the INIs for a new desktop.
     
   . MuAdmin: Now it lets the administrator customize the INIs for a new
     desktop in a more thorough way (see the "more..." button in the
     "INI Setup" dialog).
     
   . MuDesk: Now it shows the system initialization actions it is performing
     after login.
     
   . MuDesk: Now it supports a pre-login rexx script and per-user post-login
     rexx scripts.
     
   . MuDesk: Added multiple WarpCenter configuration management.
   
   . Installation adds RUN=rexinit.exe before the PROTSHELL statement, to
     initialize the REXX runtime environment and interpreter (see above,
     about pre-login and post-login scripts).
   
   . LOTS of bug fixes and enhancements in MuAdmin and MuDesk.
   
   
   v0.1.9
   ======
   
   . Mudesk.exe crashes on WSeB. Fixed.
   
   . Mudesk sometimes locks files even when the administrator logs in. Fixed.
   
   . MuAdmin sometimes can't change directory when creating new user. Fixed.
   
   . Installation adds "." to the LIBPATH, to make sure that MuAdmin can
     find its DLLs.
   
   . The archive on hobbes was named md-0-9-8 instead that md-0-1-8. BTW,
     documentation reported the correct number. Now the naming is correct.
   
   . Added a notice to the installation, informing the user about a bug
     in WarpIn that requires user intervention.

   
   v0.1.8
   ======
   
   . First public release.
